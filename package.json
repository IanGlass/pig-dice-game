  "description": "Pig is a simple turn based dice game played between two players. The objective is to be the first player with a cumulative score of 100 or greater. The rules are as follows:\r * The active player can roll the dice as many times as they likes, which increases their round score by the number shown on the dice;\r * The player can push hold which will increase their total score by their round score and change to the next player's turn;\r * However, if the player rolls a 1, they lose their current round score and it becomes the other player's turn.",
